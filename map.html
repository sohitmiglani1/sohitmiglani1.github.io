Both, however, are difficult to create without fixed \n definitions of what makes steel \u201cgreen\u201d. This may lead to the co-existence of several, but \n inherently different, certifications. Additionally, the lack of a quantified definition and \n distinction between different carbon intensities of steel products makes the enforcement of \n decarbonization policies, emission regulations, and carbon pricing schemes more difficult. Without \n international cooperation, it is difficult to achieve international market incentives promoting \n green steel sufficiently to overcome other challenges, too, such as the lack of competitiveness for \n low-carbon steel.", "to": "Green Steel Definition", "width": 0.5}, {"arrows": "to", "from": "Technology Standards", "title": "Steel plants are complex and their planning and construction take several years. Frequently, the \n process is prolonged even further by long waiting times to receive construction permits and other \n required licenses.
